#Tasks:
1. Create a result page in html/css. Make it SEO friendly.
2. Get current GEO location of the patient.
3. Define mock-data within Javascript for practices and appointments.
4. Show practices as a list on the result search page, using Javascript.
5. Show example appointments of the patient using a calender.
6. Allow the patient to filter practices by distance.

#What I reached so far
I concentrated on the first 3 tasks, since I knew I could not make all of it in this amount of time.
I first created a layout in Sketch for the result page and then began to build that in html/css. >> layout_sketch.png
Then I got the current GEO location with a JS script. >> Arzttermine_result_GEO
Next I tried to generate the "Doctors cards", meaning the entries on the result page for each practice, with Javascript >> Arzttermine_JS_content 
I declared a class with a constructor and this way automatically generated new Objects to fill the "Doctors Cards". 
It is very basic right now, but you can see what I am aiming at.
